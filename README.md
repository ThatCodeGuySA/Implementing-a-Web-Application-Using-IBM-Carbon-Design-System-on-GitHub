# Implementing a Web Application Using IBM Carbon Design System on GitHub üåê

## Overview üìñ
In this assignment, you are tasked with creating a fully functional web application utilizing the **IBM Carbon Design System**. This project is hosted in your own GitHub repository and is designed to give you hands-on experience with a robust design system focusing on **accessibility**, **usability**, and **efficient design-to-code workflows**. By the end of this assignment, you will gain a deeper understanding of integrating and customizing design systems in web development.

## Objectives üéØ
- Understand the principles and components of the IBM Carbon Design System.
- Learn to set up and manage a project repository on GitHub.
- Gain practical experience in implementing UI elements according to a design system.
- Enhance skills in web development with a focus on accessibility and responsive design.

## Requirements üìã
### 1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for your web application.
   - Ensure the repository is public to allow for grading and feedback.
   - Include this README with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any relevant information.

### 2. **IBM Carbon Design System Integration**
   - Familiarize yourself with the [IBM Carbon Design System documentation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).
   - Implement UI components using the Carbon Design System.
   - Your application should include a variety of elements such as Buttons, Forms, Navigation, Tables, and more.

### 3. **Functionality and Interactivity**
   - Incorporate interactive elements like form submissions, modal pop-ups, or dynamic tables.
   - You may use JavaScript frameworks/libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or Carbon Components Vanilla JavaScript version.

### 4. **Accessibility and Responsiveness**
   - Ensure your web application follows [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
   - The application must be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### 5. **Documentation and Code Quality**
   - Provide adequate documentation with comments for major functionalities.
   - Structure your codebase in a clean, efficient, and modular way following best practices.

## Submission Guidelines üì¨
